	// 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to
	//    the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress.

	// Both these may change in the future.
	// Incoming requests are matched against the host before the
	// IngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all
	// traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue.

	// Host can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of
	// a network host (e.g. "foo.bar.com") or "wildcard", which is a domain name
	// prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. "*.foo.com").
	// The wildcard character '*' must appear by itself as the first DNS label and
	// matches only a single label. You cannot have a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == "*").
	// Requests will be matched against the Host field in the following way:
	// 1. If Host is precise, the request matches this rule if the http host header is equal to Host.
	// 2. If Host is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule if the http host header

	// PathType determines the interpretation of the Path matching. PathType can
	// be one of the following values:
	// * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly.
	// * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
	//   done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
	//   list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
	//   match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
	//   request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
	//   of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
	//   matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
	// * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
	//   the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
	//   or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
	// Implementations are required to support all path types.
